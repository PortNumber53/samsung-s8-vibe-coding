# samsung-s8-vibe-coding
just trying to see if I can vibe code just using a Samsung Table S8, without too much Google Searches, and with what's available right now

1) Apparently I can't if I just do it using the online editor as Co-Pilot has extensions that don't work on it.

2) I can spin up a dev server using Codespaces, but switching tabs all the time will be very time consuming.
